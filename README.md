# Let's Do Some Research!
This repository will contain each and every thing needed to start research in systematic manner from beginner to expert level.

One of the most important things you'll do during your research is the literature review. One of the essential components of the literature review is reading books. Reading or referring a book for research is not the same as reading a book for the joy of it. While reading a book for research, you should keep in mind the following:
- Select the book for your research by looking at the title of the book, content of the book and the conclusions
- Make a list of keywords that are related to your research topic
- While reading through a page, scan for the above keywords to avoid spending unnecessary time
- Go through the index/ glossary to find the particular chapter/ topic that are related to your research
- Add bookmarks as pointers and prepare notes for everything you read so that you can cite and refer whenever required
