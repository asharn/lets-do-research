# Let's Do Some Research!
This repository will contain each and every thing needed to start research in systematic manner from beginner to expert level.

One of the most important things you'll do during your research is the literature review. One of the essential components of the literature review is reading books. Reading or referring a book for research is not the same as reading a book for the joy of it. While reading a book for research, you should keep in mind the following:
- Select the book for your research by looking at the title of the book, content of the book and the conclusions
- Make a list of keywords that are related to your research topic
- While reading through a page, scan for the above keywords to avoid spending unnecessary time
- Go through the index/ glossary to find the particular chapter/ topic that are related to your research
- Add bookmarks as pointers and prepare notes for everything you read so that you can cite and refer whenever required


You can find some of the recommended books to aid in your research below.

1. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani
2. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman
3. [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
4. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdf) by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin


To do research, you can go through a lot of topics of your interest and gauge how feasible those are in the time frame and whether you have the required expertise for the same. One of the resources that you'll go through in this process is the research papers. As mentioned earlier, since you need not spend a lot of time on one research paper, you should note down the following as you skim through the paper:

1. Go through the abstract; this shall give you a brief overview
2. Understand the dataset used; see if there is a link to the dataset provided
3. Look for the methodology used in the research paper; you may need to refer to the discussions and conclusion for this
4. See if you can pursue something mentioned in the future work as a research
